# Sales By Sub-Category

These are the top-performing product sub-categories. Phones and Chairs contribute a total of 32% to the revenue with each of them having 16% respectively. Sales for products in sub-categories like Appliances (5%), Bookcases (6%), Copiers and other Accessories (8% each) need to be improved. Products in these sub-categories need to be repositioned to eye-levels on the shelves to ensure that customers get to see them at a glance. Some more marketing activities need to be done to create awareness for these products. Direct sales-pitching can be done by merchandisers to incoming customers to help them know that such products are available, and the benefits of purchasing them.
